    "### Project Overview\n",
    "In order for cities to plan transportation systems, they need to have robust data on the number of people using different modes of transport. This is especially important when the urban landscape changes, such as an increase in urban density, and cities need to plan for the changes in traffic that will arrive. Typically, cities collect data on the volume of vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic. Unfortunately, collecting these data is costly and time consuming, and in some cases impossible. Often transportation engineers and planners need to understand the consequences of different design decisions, such as the estimated effect of a traffic signal on safety. Since it is impossible to build out these alternatives and then perform volume counts, engineers and planners need a way to be able to estimate the effect of changes on pedestrian volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although many cities have models to estimate the effect of the built environment on pedestrian volume, they are typically at the scale of traffic analysis zones, a geographic scale much larger compared to the intersection. Intersection-based models exist for the following locations: San Francisco, CA (1,2); Charlotte, NC (3); Alameda County, CA (4); San Diego County, CA (5); Santa Monica, CA (6); and Quebec (7). Most of these intersection-based models use either a linear or log-linear model, and the most common features found to significantly affect pedestrian volumes include population density, employment density, and transit accessibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite general agreement on the most important features, there are differences among the models on other significant features from the built environment. For example, the City of Santa Monica found the distance from the ocean to be a significant variable in prediction (6); it is highly unlikely that a landlocked city would find the significance in that variable. Even when the models agree on which features of the built environment are significant predictors, they often disagree on the extent to which they influence pedestrian volume. As suggested by Schneider et al., this variation should be addressed by creating models that are sensitive to the context of the local environment (2). Since there currently does not exist a model to predict pedestrian intersection volumes for the City of Los Angeles, my machine learning project aims to fill that gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "For this project, my goal is to answer the following statement: What is the relationship between the built environment and the daily pedestrian volumes at intersections in the City of Los Angeles?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics\n",
    "My proposed metric for evaluating my linear model is the r-squared score, the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable. I will also compute the F-Value to ensure that the regression model provides a better fit to the data than a model that contains no independent variables."

    "My proposed solution is to build a regression model that can take inputs from the built environment and predict the daily volume of pedestrians at an intersection. I will test the fit for both a linear model and log linear model, since both have been demonstrated to perform well for different cities. For my project, I prefer implementing a linear or log linear regression model because it is important to be able to describe the effect of each explanatory variable on the output. It is not just important to be able to accurately predict the pedestrian volume; it is also important to understand how the characteristics of the built environment affect the volume. I anticipate my resulting model to take one of two forms shown below:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing\n",
    "The Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) routinely collects volume data related to bicyclists, pedestrians, and motor vehicles for the purposes of transportation planning. Historically, these data have been stored in a PDF format, which makes it easy to digest a single traffic count, but prevents comparison and analysis of multiple counts. These PDF files are publicly available on the Navigate LA portal at http://navigatela.lacity.org/navigatela/. The first step to solving the proposed problem includes extracting pedestrian volume from these sheets and storing it in a format that could be used in a model. I developed a python script to read the pedestrian volume data from the PDF sheets and format them so they can be used in building the model. The daily volume (what I will be constructing a model to predict), is represented by the ‘volume’ attribute in the table.  Each row is a separate count event (‘count_id’), which occurs at an individual intersection (‘ASSETID’, ‘cl_node_id’).\n",
    "\n",
    "After extracting pedestrian volume data from these sheets, I assembled data from the built environment that I thought could possibly be significant in predicting pedestrian volume at intersections in Los Angeles. These data are public, but were assembled for a previous project at LADOT.  I looked to the literature review to inform the types of data to collect for evaluating. My built environment data (explanatory variables) include:\n",
    "* Population within 0.25 mi.  (‘SUM_POPTTL’)\n",
    "* Employment within 0.25 mi. (‘EMPTOT’)\n",
    "* Count of Schools within 0.25 mi. (‘SCH_CT’)\n",
    "* Presence of a traffic signal (‘SIG’, 1 = yes, 0 = no)\n",
    "* Count of transit stops within 100 ft. (‘TRANSITSTOP’)\n",
    "* Transit Ridership (‘RIDERSHIP’)\n",

    "In this section, the process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques that you implemented for the given data will need to be clearly documented.
